# MLCourseProject

Class project for the "Practical Machine Learning" Coursera class (Data Science Specialization)

* In this project we use Random Forest to determine the type of activity being done, 
given a specific set of accelerometer measurements. 
We will use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 
participants, who were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

* We will train a Random Forest machine learning algorithm (with cross-validation) 
using a subset of this data, and then use it on an independent (testing) subset 
of data to estimate the efficiency of the model through its out-of-sample error in predicting a specific class of activity.

* HTML of the markdown is available [here](http://aficnar.github.io/MLCourseProject/course_project.html)
